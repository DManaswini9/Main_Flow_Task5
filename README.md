## ðŸš€ Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Imported and explored the dataset of product reviews  
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“  
   - Text cleaning  
   - Tokenization  
   - Stopword removal  
   - Lemmatization  
3. **Feature Extraction** â€“ Converted text to numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**  
4. **Model Building** â€“ Implemented multiple classification algorithms:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Naive Bayes  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Compared models using:  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-Score  
6. **Predictions** â€“ Classified unseen product reviews into sentiment categories
